    "The **AzureOpenAI-ResearchPaperAnalyzer** project is designed to facilitate the analysis of research papers using the powerful capabilities of Azure OpenAI. The primary objective of this project is to automate the extraction and categorization of key insights from research papers written in markdown format. By leveraging Azure OpenAI's advanced natural language processing abilities, the script can:  \n",

    "- Process markdown files of research papers.  \n",
    "- Extract key insights and bullet points from the text.  \n",
    "- Categorize the extracted information according to different research fields, funding sources, and affiliations.  \n",
    "- Generate a summary of the paper's content and structure.  \n",
    "- Format and save the results into a CSV file for easy analysis and reporting.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "### Guidelines for Analysis:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Funding Sources**:  \n",
    "    - Look for explicit mentions of funding agencies, grant names, organizations, or any other details related to financial support for the study.  \n",
    "    - Include direct quotes from the text that support the identification of funding sources.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **No Funding Reported**:  \n",
    "    - If the notes explicitly state that no funding sources were used or reported, respond with a JSON document that reflects this absence.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Output Format**:  \n",
    "    - You must respond with a single JSON document, using the following JSON structure:  \n",
    "      {  \n",
    "        \"source\": \"funding source or 'None reported'\",  \n",
    "        \"reasoning\": \"Short paragraph describing the reasoning behind choosing the funding source or absence of funding\",  \n",

    "        ]  \n",
    "      }  \n",
    "    - If no funding sources are mentioned, set `\"source\"` to `\"None reported\"` and provide reasoning and quotes indicating the lack of funding.  \n",
    "    - Do not include any additional text, markdown, or commentary outside of the JSON document.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Ambiguity**:  \n",
    "    - If the funding information is ambiguous or incomplete, explain this in the `\"reasoning\"` field and use available quotes to support your interpretation.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Comprehensive Analysis**:  \n",
    "    - Treat all provided notes as a cohesive input, combining information across multiple parts if necessary.  \n",
    "    - Ensure no funding-related detail is overlooked.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "6. **Avoid Inference**:  \n",
    "    - Do not infer funding sources based on context or assumptions.  \n",
    "    - Only report explicitly stated funding information.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "7. **Clarity and Accuracy**:  \n",
