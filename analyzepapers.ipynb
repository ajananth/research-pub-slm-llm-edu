    "The **AzureOpenAI-ResearchPaperAnalyzer** project is designed to facilitate the analysis of research papers using the powerful capabilities of Azure OpenAI. The primary objective of this project is to automate the extraction and categorization of key insights from research papers written in markdown format. By leveraging Azure OpenAI's advanced natural language processing abilities, the script can:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Process markdown files of research papers.  \n",
    "- Extract key insights and bullet points from the text.  \n",
    "- Categorize the extracted information according to different research fields, funding sources, and affiliations.  \n",
    "- Generate a summary of the paper's content and structure.  \n",
    "- Format and save the results into a CSV file for easy analysis and reporting.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This tool aims to save researchers significant time and effort by automating the tedious process of reading and summarizing lengthy research papers, allowing them to focus more on the critical aspects of their work.  \n",
